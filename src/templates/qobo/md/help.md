## I have stuff on squareBracket or the old version of Qobo, how do I bring that here?
It's simple! By going on our [migration](/migrate.php) page, you can log onto your old squareBracket/Qobo account(s) and
bring all of your old stuff over here, provided they're suitable for the new Qobo guidelines. However, you have until
[placeholder] to do so.

## I see a submission that shouldn't be allowed in the guidelines. How do I report it?
There should be a report button on each and every submission however if it's urgent then contact people who have the "Qobo Moderators" role in the Bittoco [Discord](https://discord.gg/bitview-386969055317458970).
